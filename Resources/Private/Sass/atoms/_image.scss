label: Responsive Images

    note: |
        These new elements display inline by default,
        but that's not the expected behavior for either one.
        This can interfere with proper layout and aspect-ratio handling.

        1. Remove the unnecessary wrapping `picture`, while maintaining contents
        2. Source elements have nothing to display, so we hide them entirely

/* @docs
label: Aspect Ratios

    note: |
        Maintain intrinsic aspect ratios when `max-width` is applied.
    `iframe`, `embed`, and `object` are also embedded,
        but have no intrinsic ratio,
        so their `height` needs to be set explicitly.
